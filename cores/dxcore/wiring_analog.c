       * by detecting the case where WOA or WOB is outputting PWM already, and the user then
       * calls analogWrite() on the other pin assigned to that channel, and we could swap that

       * the added capability would even be an improvement overall, because the cost in
       * terms of less consistent behavior is significant: the results become path-dependant,
       * since writing WOA, WOC, WOB in that order would result in WOC getting swapped to
       * WOB (now WOB and WOC would output same thing) while WOA, WOB, WOC would not, so
       * WOA and WOC would be the pair outputting the same thing). And then you'd need to
       * decide how to handle the above situation when the user then wrote to WOD.
