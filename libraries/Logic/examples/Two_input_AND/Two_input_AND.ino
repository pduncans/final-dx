| megaAVR Configurable Custom Logic library                             |

| Two_input_AND.ino                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| A library for interfacing with the megaAVR Configurable Custom Logic. |
| Developed in 2019 by MCUdude. Example fixed Spence Konde 2021         |
| This version is part of DxCore for AVR DA, DB, etc. Example works for |
| megaAVR 0-series and tinyAVR 0/1/2-series as well.                    |
|                                                                       |
| In this example we use the configurable logic peripherals the the     |
| megaAVR to create a 2-input AND gate using logic block 0 on PORT A.   |
| The example is pretty straight forward, but the truth table value may |
| be a little difficult to understand at first glance.                  |
| We will only use PA1 and PA2 as inputs. when the first input is       |
| disabled it will always be read as 0, and the output doesn't matter.  |
| Here's how 0x40 turns out to be the correct value to create a 2-input |
| NAND gate (or one of them rather - with 4 dont-care bits, there are   |
| 16 that will all give the same behavior)                              |
|                                     2-input AND truth table:          |
| If we look at the truth table       |IN2|IN1|IN0| Y |                 |
| to the right, we can see that       |PA2|PA1|---|OUT|                 |
| all binary values for Y can         |---|---|---|---|                 |
| be represented as x1x0x0x0.         | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |                 |
| Using a 0 for all don't care bits   | 0 | 0 | 1 | x | IN0 is always 0 |
| gives us 0b01000000 or 0x40 in hex  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |                 |
| 0b11000000 is just as valid and     | 0 | 1 | 1 | x | IN0 is always 0 |
| might be more "obvious" at a glance | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |                 |
| so 0xC0 is just as good. However    | 1 | 0 | 1 | x | IN0 is always 0 |
| it is harder to defend choices like | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |                 |
| 0b01100010 - same behavior, but     | 1 | 1 | 1 | x | IN0 is always 0 |
| much more confusing, because the reader will immediately assume that  |
| those 1's to the right mean something - when in fact they're never    |
| used if input0 is masked!                                             |
