| megaAVR Configurable Custom Logic library                             |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| A library for interfacing with the megaAVR Configurable Custom Logic. |
| Developed in 2019 by MCUdude. Example fixed Spence Konde 2021         |
| This version is part of DxCore for AVR DA, DB, etc. Example works for |
| megaAVR 0-series and tinyAVR 0/1/2-series as well.                    |
|                                                                       |
| In this example we use the configurable logic peripherals the the     |
| megaAVR to create a 2-input OR gate using logic block 0 on PORT A.    |
| The example is pretty straight forward, but the truth table value may |
| be a little difficult to understand at first glance.                  |
| We will only use PA1 and PA2 as inputs. when the first input is       |
| disabled it will always be read as 0.                                 |
| Here's how 0xFE turns out to be the correct value to create a 2-input |
| OR gate:                                                              |
|                                     2-input OR truth table:           |
|                                     |IN2|IN1|IN0| Y |                 |
| If we look at the truth table       |PA2|PA1|---|OUT|                 |
| to the right, we can see that       |---|---|---|---|                 |
| all binary values for Y can         | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |                 |
| be represented as x1x0x0x0.         | 0 | 0 | 1 | x | IN0 is always 0 |
| Using a 0 for all don't care bits   | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |                 |
| gives us 0b01010100. But that isn't | 0 | 1 | 1 | x | IN0 is always 0 |
| a great choice in terms of code     | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |                 |
| readability. Either 0b11111100 or   | 1 | 0 | 1 | x | IN0 is always 0 |
| 0b11111110 do a more unambiguous    | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |                 |
| job of communicating to the reader  | 1 | 1 | 1 | x | IN0 is always 0 |
| that anything except a 0 on all inputs                                |
| that aren't masked will result in a 1 output.                         |
