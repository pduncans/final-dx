/* Example 3: High speed 8-bit PWM
 * https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore/blob/master/megaavr/extras/TakingOverTCA0.md
 *
 * A user of megaTinyCore requested (#152) high speed PWM. They wanted split mode disabled, and PWM frequency higher
 * than 62KHz. This is indeed possible - though do note that the maximum frequency of PWM possible with a full 8 bits
 * of resolution is 78.125 kHz when running at 20 MHz (20000000/256); at 24, it's 93.75 kHz, and overclocked to 32 MHz,
 * 125 kHz. The next highest  frequency for which perfect 8-bit resolution is possible is half of those frequencies.
 * Higher fequencies require lower resolution (see above example for one approach, which can also be used for
 * intermediate frequencies) - though if the frequency is constant, varying your input between 0 and the period instead
 * of using map() is desirable, as map may not be smooth. As a further aside, if 78.125kHz is suitable, there is no
 * need to disable split mode (ynless other features were required, like event inputs or buffering (which might well
 * be what the original requester wanted single mode for)
 * It strikes me now, as I adapt this example for the Dx-series parts, that 62 KHz is almost exactly the maximum
 * possible for 8-bit PWM at 16 MHz system clock. I'm pretty sure there's a connection!
 *
 * Do note that if pushing the PWM frequency is your aim, you can go considerably higher by using the Type D timer.
 * It is rated for a TCD clock of up to 48 MHz.... (and I was able to generate PWM from it without anomalies with
 * it clocked at 128 MHz (32 MHz system clock multiplied by 4, using the 4x multiplier setting that was in the initial
 * io headers, but was pulled from the datasheet before release, and the headers shortly after) - these parts have a
 * ton of headroom on frequency at room temp and under non-adverse conditions)
